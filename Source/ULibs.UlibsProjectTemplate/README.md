The first sentence in this file provides the summary text for the micro-library's NuGet package. The entire contents provide the description for the package. Keep the first sentence short and to the point, and then further elaborate in the following sentences. Due to the limitations of NuGet, it's important to keep this description to a single short paragraph, avoid new-line characters, and avoid "unfriendly" characters (especially semicolons!). If in doubt, you can test the resulting package using [NuGet Package Explorer](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer).
