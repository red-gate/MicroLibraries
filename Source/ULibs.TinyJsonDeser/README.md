A lightweight thread-safe JsonDeserializer class that can deserialize json text to .NET types. It does not support binding to specific .NET types. Rather, objects are deserialized to instances of `IDictionary<string, object>`, arrays are deserialized to instances of `object[]`, and literals are deserialized to either a `bool`, `double`, `string` or `null`.
