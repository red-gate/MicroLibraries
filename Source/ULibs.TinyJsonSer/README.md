A lightweight thread-safe JsonSerializer class that can serialize arbitrary objects to either indented or compact json. Dates are converted to a standard ISO 8601 UTC date format (`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`). Property and field names of objects are converted to lower camel case, though dictionary keys are serialized as-is. For Redgaters, this library is intended to mirror the behaviour of the `Newtonsoft.Json` serializer in the Redgate Usage Client.
